                The CN Tower (French: Tour CN) is a 553.3 m-high (1,815.3 ft)
                concrete communications and observation tower in downtown
                Toronto, Ontario, CanadaBuilt on the former Railway Lands, it
                was completed in 1976. Its name "CN" referred to Canadian
                National, the railway company that built the tower. Following
                the railway's decision to divest non-core freight railway assets
                prior to the company's privatization in 1995, it transferred the
                tower to the Canada Lands Company, a federal Crown corporation
                responsible for real estate development.The CN Tower held the
                record for the world's tallest free-standing structure for 32
                years, from 1975 until 2007, when it was surpassed by the Burj
                Khalifa, and was the world's tallest tower until 2009 when it
                was surpassed by the Canton Tower. It is currently the
                ninth-tallest free-standing structure in the world and remains
                the tallest free-standing structure on land in the Western
                Hemisphere. In 1995, the CN Tower was declared one of the modern
                Seven Wonders of the World by the American Society of Civil
                Engineers. It also belongs to the World Federation of Great
                Towers. It is a signature icon of Toronto's skyline and attracts
                more than two million international visitors annually. It houses
                several observation decks, a revolving restaurant at some 1,150
                feet (350 m), and an entertainment complex.

              <p>
                The CN Tower is the tallest freestanding structure in the
                Western Hemisphere. As of 2013, there are only two other
                freestanding structures in the Western Hemisphere which exceed
                500 m (1,640.4 ft) in height; the Willis Tower in Chicago, which
                stands at 527 m (1,729.0 ft) when measured to its pinnacle; and
                the topped-out One World Trade Center in New York City, which
                has a pinnacle height of 541.33 m (1,776.0 ft), or approximately
                12 m (39.4 ft) shorter than the CN Tower. Due to the symbolism
                of the number 1776 (the year of the signing of the United States
                Declaration of Independence), the height of One World Trade
                Center is unlikely to be increased. The proposed Chicago Spire
                was expected to exceed the height of the CN Tower, but its
                construction was halted early due to financial difficulties amid
                the Great Recession, and was eventually cancelled in 2010.
              </p>
              <p>
                Guinness World Records has called the CN Tower "the world's
                tallest self-supporting tower" and "the world's tallest
                free-standing tower". Although Guinness did list this
                description of the CN Tower under the heading "tallest building"
                at least once, it has also listed it under "tallest tower",
                omitting it from its list of "tallest buildings." In 1996,
                Guinness changed the tower's classification to "World's Tallest
                Building and Freestanding Structure". Emporis and the Council on
                Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat both listed the CN Tower as the
                world's tallest free-standing structure on land, and
                specifically state that the CN Tower is not a true building,
                thereby awarding the title of world's tallest building to Taipei
                101, which is 44 metres (144 ft) shorter than the CN Tower.
              </p>
              <p>
                Theissue of what was tallest became moot when Burj Khalifa, then
                under construction, exceeded the height of the CN Tower in 2007
                (see below). Although the CN Tower contains a restaurant, a gift
                shop and multiple observation levels, it does not have floors
                continuously from the ground, and therefore it is not considered
                a building by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat
                (CTBUH) or Emporis. CTBUH defines a building as "a structure
                that is designed for residential, business, or manufacturing
                purposes. An essential characteristic of a building is that it
                has floors." The CN Tower and other similar structures—such as
                the Ostankino Tower in Moscow, Russia; the Oriental Pearl Tower
                in Shanghai, China; The Strat in Las Vegas, Nevada, United
                States; and the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France—are categorized as
                "towers", which are free-standing structures that may have
                observation decks and a few other habitable levels, but do not
                have floors from the ground up. The CN Tower was the tallest
                tower by this definition until 2010 (see below). Taller than the
                CN Tower are numerous radio masts and towers, which are held in
                place by guy-wires, the tallest being the KVLY-TV mast in
                Blanchard, North Dakota, in the United States at 628 metres
                (2,060 ft) tall, leading to a distinction between these and
                "free-standing" structures. Additionally, the Petronius Platform
                stands 610 metres (2,001 ft) above its base on the bottom of the
                Gulf of Mexico, but only the top 75 metres (246 ft) of this oil
                and natural gas platform are above water, and the structure is
                thus partially supported by its buoyancy. Like the CN Tower,
                none of these taller structures are commonly considered
                buildings. On September 12, 2007, Burj Khalifa, which is a
                hotel, residential and commercial building in Dubai, United Arab
                Emirates, and was formerly known as Burj Dubai before opening,
                passed the CN Tower's 553.33-metre height. The CN Tower held
                the record of tallest freestanding structure on land for over 30
                years. After Burj Khalifa had been formally recognized by the
                Guinness World Records as the world's tallest freestanding
                structure, Guinness re-certified CN Tower as the world's tallest
                freestanding tower. The tower definition used by Guinness was
                defined by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat as 'a
                building in which less than 50% of the construction is usable
                floor space'.

                Guinness World Records editor-in-chief Craig Glenday announced
                that Burj Khalifa was not classified as a tower because it has
                too much usable floor space to be considered to be a tower.CN
                Tower still held world records for highest above ground wine
                cellar (in 360 Restaurant) at 351 metres, highest above ground
                restaurant at 346 metres (Horizons Restaurant), and tallest
                free-standing concrete tower during Guinness's recertification.
                The CN Tower was surpassed in 2009 by the Canton Tower in
                Guangzhou, China, which stands at 604 metres (1,982 ft) tall, as
                the world's tallest tower; which in turn was surpassed by the
                Tokyo Skytree in 2011, which currently is the tallest tower at
                634.0 metres (2,080.1 ft) in height. The CN Tower, as of 2018,
                stands as the ninth-tallest free-standing structure on land,
                remains the tallest free-standing structure in the Western
                Hemisphere, and is the third-tallest tower.
