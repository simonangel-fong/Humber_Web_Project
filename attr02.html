            The Royal Ontario Museum (ROM) is a museum of art, world culture and natural history in Toronto,
            Ontario, Canada. It is one of the largest museums in North America and the largest in Canada.
            It attracts more than one million visitors every year, making the ROM the most-visited museum in Canada.
            The museum is north of Queen's Park, in the University of Toronto district, with its main entrance on Bloor
            Street West.
            Museum subway station is named after the ROM and, since a 2008 renovation,
            is decorated to resemble the institution's collection at the platform level.
            Established on April 16, 1912, and opened on March 19, 1914, the museum has maintained close relations with
            the University
            of Toronto throughout its history, often sharing expertise and resources. The museum was under the direct
            control and management
            of the University of Toronto until 1968, when it became an independent Crown agency of the Government of
            Ontario.
            Today, the museum is Canada's largest field-research institution, with research and conservation activities
            around
            the world. With more than 6,000,000 items and 40 galleries, the museum's diverse collections of world
            culture and
            natural history contribute to its international reputation. The museum contains a collection of dinosaurs,
            minerals
            and meteorites; Canadian, and European historical artifacts; as well as African, Near Eastern, and East
            Asian art.
            It houses the world's largest collection of fossils from the Burgess Shale with more than 150,000 specimens.
            The museum also contains an extensive collection of design and fine art, including clothing, interior,
            and product design, especially Art Deco.

              <p>
                The Royal Ontario Museum was formally established on April 16, 1912, and was jointly governed by the
                Government of Ontario and the University of Toronto. Its first assets were transferred from the
                university and the Ontario Department of Education, coming from its predecessor, the Museum of Natural
                History and Fine Arts at the Toronto Normal School. On 19 March 1914, the Duke of Connaught, also the
                governor general of Canada, officially opened the Royal Ontario Museum to the public. The museum's
                location at the edge of Toronto's built-up area, far from the city's central business district, was
                selected mainly for its proximity to the University of Toronto. The original building was constructed on
                the western edge of the property along the university's Philosopher's Walk, with its main entrance
                facing out onto Bloor Street housing five separate museums of the following fields: Archaeology,
                Palaeontology, Mineralogy, Zoology, and Geology. It cost CA$400,000 to construct. This was the first
                phase of a two-part construction plan that intended to expand the museum towards Queen's Park Crescent,
                ultimately creating an H-shaped structure.

                The Royal Ontario Museum, circa 1930s The first expansion to the Royal Ontario Museum publicly opened on
                October 12, 1933.
                The CA$1.8-million renovation saw the construction of the east wing fronting onto Queen's Park and
                required the demolition of Argyle House,
                a Victorian mansion at 100 Queen's Park. As this occurred during the Great Depression, an effort was
                made to use primarily local building
                materials and to make use of workers capable of manually excavating the building's foundations. Teams of
                workers alternated weeks of
                service due to the physically draining nature of the job.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 1947, the ROM was dissolved as a body corporate, with all assets
                transferred to the University of Toronto. The museum remained a part of the university until 1968, when
                the museum
                and the McLaughlin Planetarium were separated from the university to form a new corporation.
                On 26 October 1968, the ROM opened the McLaughlin Planetarium on the south end of the property after
                receiving a CA$2 million
                donation from Colonel Samuel McLaughlin. In December 1995, the ROM closed the McLaughlin Planetarium as
                a result of budgetary cutbacks imposed
                by the Government of Ontario. The space temporarily reopened from 1998 to 2002, after being leased to
                Children's Own Museum. In 2009,
                the ROM sold the building to the University of Toronto for CA$22 million and ensured that it would
                continue to be used for institutional and academic purposes
              </p>
              <p>
                The second major addition to the museum was the Queen Elizabeth II Terrace Galleries on the north side
                of the building and a curatorial centre built on the south, which started in 1978 and was completed in
                1984. The new construction meant that a former outdoor "Chinese Garden" to the north of the building
                facing Bloor, along with an adjoining indoor restaurant, had to be dismantled. Opened in 1984 by Queen
                Elizabeth II, the CA$55 million expansion took the form of layered terraces, each rising layer stepping
                back from Bloor Street. The design of this expansion won a Governor-General's Award in Architecture.

                In1989, activists complained about its Into the Heart of Africa exhibit, which featured stereotypes of
                Africans, forcing curator Jeanne Cannizzo to resign. </p>

              Beginning in 2002, the museum underwent a major renovation and expansion project dubbed as Renaissance
              ROM.
              <p> The Ontario and Canadian governments, both supporters of this venture, contributed $60 million towards
                the project, and Michael Lee-Chin donated $30 million. The campaign aimed not only to raise annual
                visitor attendance from 750,000 to between 1.4 and 1.6 million, but also to generate additional funding
                opportunities to support the museum's research, conservation, galleries and educational public programs.
                The centrepiece of the project was a deconstructivist crystalline-form structure called the Michael
                Lee-Chin Crystal. The structure was created by architect Daniel Libeskind, whose design was selected
                from among 50 finalists in an international competition. </p> The design of the Crystal required the
              Terrace Galleries to be torn down (the curatorial centre to the south remains). Existing galleries and
              buildings were also upgraded, along with the installation of multiple new exhibits over a period of
              months. The first phase of the Renaissance ROM project, the "Ten Renovated Galleries in the Historic
              Buildings", opened to the public on 26 December 2005. The architectural opening for the Michael Lee-Chin
              Crystal, however, took place less than 18 months later, on 2 June 2007. The final cost of the project was
              about CA$270 million.

              The original building was listed by the City of Toronto on the Municipal Heritage Register on 20 June
              1973, designated under Part IV of the Ontario Heritage Act in 2003, with a Heritage Easement on the
              buildings
