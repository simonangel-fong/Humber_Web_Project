            <h5>Niagara Falls</h5>
            <p>
              Niagara Falls (/naɪˈæɡərə/) is a group of three waterfalls at
              the southern end of Niagara Gorge, spanning the border between
              the province of Ontario in Canada and the state of New York in
              the United States. The largest of the three is Horseshoe Falls,
              which straddles the international border of the two countries.
              It is also known as the Canadian Falls. The smaller American
              Falls and Bridal Veil Falls lie within the United States. Bridal
              Veil Falls is separated from Horseshoe Falls by Goat Island and
              from American Falls by Luna Island, with both islands situated
              in New York.<br /><br />

              Formed by the Niagara River, which drains Lake Erie into Lake
              Ontario, the combined falls have the highest flow rate of any
              waterfall in North America that has a vertical drop of more than
              50 m (160 ft). During peak daytime tourist hours, more than
              168,000 m3 (5.9 million cu ft) of water goes over the crest of
              the falls every minute. Horseshoe Falls is the most powerful
              waterfall in North America, as measured by flow rate. Niagara
              Falls is famed for its beauty and is a valuable source of
              hydroelectric power. Balancing recreational, commercial, and
              industrial uses has been a challenge for the stewards of the
              falls since the 19th century.

            <h5>History</h5>
            <p>
              Many figures have been suggested as first circulating a European
              eyewitness description of Niagara Falls. The Frenchman Samuel de
              Champlain visited the area as early as 1604 during his
              exploration of Canada, and members of his party reported to him
              the spectacular waterfalls, which he described in his journals.
              The first description of the falls is credited to Belgian
              missionary, Father Louis Hennepin in 1677, after traveling with
              the explorer René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, thus
              bringing the falls to the attention of Europeans.
              <br /><br />
              French Jesuit missionary Paul Ragueneau likely visited the falls
              some 35 years before Hennepin's visit while working among the
              Huron First Nation in Canada. Jean de Brébeuf also may have
              visited the falls, while spending time with the Neutral
              Nation.[42] The Finnish-Swedish naturalist Pehr Kalm explored
              the area in the early 18th century and is credited with the
              first scientific description of the falls. In 1762, Captain
              Thomas Davies, a British Army officer and artist, surveyed the
              area and painted the watercolor, An East View of the Great
              Cataract of Niagara, the first eyewitness painting of the falls.
